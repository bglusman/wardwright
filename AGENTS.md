# AGENTS.md — Wardwright

Workspace-wide instructions for AI coding agents operating on this public repo.

## What This Repo Is

Wardwright is experimental LLM model middleware extracted from Calciforge's
model-gateway work. Clients call stable OpenAI-compatible model names while
Wardwright owns route graphs, policy/governance, provider selection, caller
traceability, simulation, and receipts.

The repo previously contained multiple backend and frontend prototypes. The
active tree is now BEAM-first:

- `app`
- `contracts`
- `docs`

## Public Repo Rules

Read `CLAUDE.md` before committing. It contains the public-repo secret
discipline rules, never-commit list, and gitleaks workflow. Those rules apply
to every agent, not only Claude.

In short:

- Do not commit secrets, bearer tokens, API keys, private endpoints, real
  deployment identifiers, real private model names, or private user/chat IDs.
- Use `.example` files and RFC-reserved placeholders.
- Do not bypass gitleaks or pre-commit checks.
- Do not put prompt text, credentials, or provider tokens in command argv.
- Do not log provider credentials or raw user content by default.

## Project Vocabulary

- **Wardwright** — the tentative product name.
- **Ingary** — the historical working name. Public project pages now use
  `wardwright.dev`.
- **Wardwright model** — stable public model contract backed by route,
  policy, governance, simulation, and receipt behavior.
- **Route graph** — dispatcher/cascade/alloy/guard/concrete model graph.
- **Receipt** — structured record explaining route decisions, policy actions,
  provider attempts, caller provenance, and final status.
- **Governor / policy engine** — bounded decision layer for request transforms,
  routing, stream/output governance, alerts, retries, and receipt annotations.
- **Caller provenance** — tenant/application/agent/user/session/run metadata.

## Build / Test

```bash
# App
(cd app && mise exec -- mix format --check-formatted && mise exec -- mix test)
```

## Product Contract Rules

- Read `docs/architecture-ratchets.md` and `docs/testing-ratchets.md` before
  large feature work. They capture the anti-god-object, ownership, typed-data,
  concurrency, and behavior-test rules this repo expects agents to preserve.
- Keep the OpenAI-compatible serving surface stable unless the contract changes
  intentionally in `contracts/openapi.yaml`.
- Keep receipt summary shape consistent with the contract. In particular,
  `/v1/receipts` rows must include nested `caller` provenance.
- Keep generated/dynamic model tests portable across implementations when a
  second implementation is intentionally added.
- Treat storage as a product contract, not an implementation detail. Update
  `contracts/storage-provider-contract.md` when changing durable behavior.
- Treat policy language as an engine choice behind a shared ABI. Starlark is the
  first intended portable advanced language; built-in declarative governors
  should cover common cases first.
- UI must distinguish live backend state from mock/not-implemented state.

## Git

- Prefer feature branches and PRs once branch protection is enabled.
- Do not push directly to `main` except for initial bootstrap/admin work before
  protections exist.
- Run `bash scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` in new clones.
- Before merging any PR, inspect every PR review comment and review thread,
  including automated reviewer comments. Address correct feedback in code or
  docs, and explicitly decide/document when a comment is not being changed
  because it is incorrect or out of scope. Do not merge while substantive
  review threads are unconsidered.
