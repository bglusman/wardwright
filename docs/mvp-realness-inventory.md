# MVP Realness Inventory

This inventory separates real behavior from prototype scaffolding. The goal is
not to remove every fixture before MVP; it is to identify which seams must stop
pretending before remote users or external agents depend on them.

The current bar is not production completeness. A real but simplistic
implementation is acceptable when it preserves a plausible long-term interface,
keeps ownership boundaries clear, and behaves honestly under unsupported input.
Unsupported features should either be ignored because they are explicitly
non-authoritative for the current path, logged for later review, or rejected with
a clear error that names the missing capability.

## Recently Fixed

- State-machine simulation paths no longer infer states from hard-coded trace
  event ids. Trace events now carry `state_id` when the simulation knows the
  state, and the state-machine projection falls back to node membership only
  when that evidence is absent.

## Streaming Tool-Call Passthrough Slice

- Plan: keep this slice at the OpenAI-compatible stream adapter boundary. Parse
  upstream SSE `delta.tool_calls`, carry those deltas through the existing
  provider runtime, and write OpenAI-compatible downstream SSE chunks without
  changing VCR, allowed-tool policy, workbench replay, or scenario fixtures.
- Adversarial plan review: the narrow pass-through avoids inventing tool
  authorization in the stream transport, but it also means stream policy still
  governs text content only. Tool-call argument validation remains a separate
  control-layer problem.
- Implementation notes: tool-call deltas are emitted as internal stream events,
  downstream chunks preserve the `delta.tool_calls` shape, and receipts record
  only `preserved_delta_fields: ["tool_calls"]` plus terminal metadata rather
  than raw tool-call arguments.
- Adversarial implementation/design review: this is intentionally not a general
  OpenAI stream mirror. Role, logprobs, and arbitrary provider-specific delta
  fields remain unsupported, and a tool-call delta starts the downstream SSE
  response before any later text-policy retry can occur.
- Test evidence: focused fake-provider coverage asserts that streaming
  OpenAI-compatible tool-call deltas reach the client as SSE and that receipt
  metadata records the preserved field without storing the raw arguments.

## Minimally Real Now

- Provider streaming is not purely mocked. The runtime can stream from
  OpenAI-compatible SSE and Ollama NDJSON targets through `ProviderRuntime`,
  parse upstream chunks incrementally, apply stream policy before release, and
  cancel provider work when policy halts.
- Stream termination is handled for the current supported paths. Wardwright
  emits downstream `data: [DONE]` after normal completion and after terminal
  policy/provider events once an SSE response has started.
- OpenAI-compatible SSE and Ollama NDJSON terminal metadata is preserved in
  receipts at a minimal allowlisted level. Receipts now expose stream format,
  completion status/reason, and common token/timing fields when providers emit
  them.
- OpenAI-compatible streaming `delta.tool_calls` are passed through to
  downstream SSE clients while receipts record only the fact that tool-call
  deltas were preserved.
- Provider records expose a versioned capability map for the currently
  supported adapter shapes. The map describes endpoint shape, stream format,
  auth scheme, terminal metadata support, cancellation confidence, unsupported
  request fields, unsupported stream delta fields, and the current
  unsupported-options policy. Provider calls now fail loudly before contacting
  the upstream adapter when request fields such as OpenAI-compatible tool calls
  would otherwise be silently dropped.
- Tool-context facts from OpenAI-compatible request fields and caller metadata
  are normalized into receipt decision evidence and receipt-list filters. The
  workbench now has an explicit tool-governance projection for planning,
  result-interpretation, loop-governance, and receipt phases. These projections
  still do not enforce tool selector policies, but normalized request tool
  context now records session-scoped `tool_call` cache events that existing
  history-threshold policies can count.
- Live provider smoke tests have an explicit non-CI profile. `mise run
  test:live-providers` fails clearly unless at least one live target is
  configured, then verifies streaming, receipt metadata, and non-mock provider
  execution against those configured targets.
- Policy retry loops are real for stream guards. A retry can inject a reminder,
  reroute when the retry prompt exceeds the current model context window, and
  record the attempt path in receipts.
- History-aware policy cache behavior is backed by runtime storage and tests,
  not only projection fixtures.
- The policy-authoring API has protected HTTP endpoints for tool discovery,
  projections, simulations, validation, local model drafting/activation, Dune
  snippet management, and persisted authoring scenarios. Scenario writes are
  minimal but real records consumed by simulations instead of hard-coded UI-only
  state. The store is memory-backed by default and can be configured to persist
  records to a local JSON file.
- Pinned authoring scenarios can be exported as a versioned regression pack, and
  retention can prune oldest unpinned scenario records without deleting pinned
  regression evidence.
- Pinned scenario packs can also export generated ExUnit source. The generated
  tests validate pack coherence and replay pinned scenario records through the
  current policy-scenario/projection contracts.

## Still Prototype Or Fixture Backed

- Projection simulations prefer persisted scenario records when present, then
  fall back to explicit fixture examples. Persisted records can be imported from
  receipts, but do not yet replay receipt inputs or execute generated inputs.
- The state-machine model is still embedded in projection code. It should move
  toward artifact-declared states/transitions or a compiler pass that emits a
  state projection from policy primitives and sandbox regions.
- Assistant authoring is still experimental. The in-page assistant can inspect,
  simulate, validate, draft, and propose through the same tool registry, but
  durable writes still need explicit review boundaries and activation must be
  confirmed by tool output.
- Tool discovery is available over protected HTTP, and a first Hermes-backed MCP
  server is mounted at `/mcp` for projection, simulation, Dune snippet,
  draft/activate/propose, and artifact validation tools. Scenario write/import/
  export/retention tools remain HTTP-only until the MCP auth/review boundary is
  explicit.
- Tool-context normalization is receipt/projection-only. It intentionally stops
  short of selector enforcement, tool-scoped policy bundles, or trusted
  cross-session tool counters until the tool-policy contract settles.
- The policy workbench now runs edited turns and saved scenario/test-case records
  through the deterministic simulator for the selected registered model. It does
  not yet execute live-provider replay from those cases or show artifact diffs.
- Canned providers remain first-class in tests and local configs. That is useful
  for deterministic coverage, but remote MVP needs a clear way to distinguish
  demo targets from production targets in UI and API responses.

## Provider Streaming Gaps Before Remote MVP

- Real-provider smoke tests now have a local profile, but they still need to be
  run and reviewed against the operator's actual Ollama and OpenAI-compatible
  targets before remote MVP. Baseline CI still uses local fake HTTP providers,
  which prove transport shape but not provider-specific drift.
- Upstream stream metadata is only minimally preserved. OpenAI `finish_reason`,
  usage chunks, refusal fields, and common Ollama terminal timing/count fields
  are allowlisted in receipts and advertised in provider capability records, but
  role, logprob, and arbitrary provider-specific deltas are not preserved.
- Downstream SSE chunks emit content deltas, OpenAI-compatible tool-call
  deltas, and Wardwright terminal events. They do not preserve upstream role,
  logprob, or usage deltas.
- Provider timeout is enforced by `ProviderRuntime`, but lower-level HTTP stream
  collection still has a hard-coded `180000ms` fallback. The outer timeout is
  the active guard for configured targets; the inner timeout should still be
  parameterized or documented as a safety fallback.
- Cancellation relies on cancelling the provider task and `:httpc` request.
  This is tested for local tasks and fake providers, but should be smoke-tested
  against real long-running streams to verify upstream sockets close promptly.
- Negotiation is minimal. The OpenAI-compatible adapter assumes
  `/chat/completions`, bearer auth, and text/event-stream. It does not yet
  handle provider variants that require extra stream options, alternate base
  paths, or nonstandard terminal frames.

- Provider capability records are partial enforcement points. Tool-call request
  fields are rejected when a selected adapter cannot preserve them, but broader
  provider-specific options still need capability checks when they affect policy
  correctness.
- Unsupported provider features should be ignored only when they cannot affect
  policy correctness. If they could affect safety, routing, stream release, or
  receipt truth, the adapter should fail clearly.

## Policy And Simulation Gaps Before Remote MVP

- Scenario records have a first minimal store: user-written, assistant-generated,
  fixture, and live-replay scenarios can be represented with source and pinned
  status. The store supports optional JSON-file durability, receipt import,
  pinned regression export, and unpinned retention pruning.
- Simulation should execute against compiled policy logic and selected scenario
  inputs instead of only returning canned projection examples.
- Regression export generates ExUnit source for the BEAM prototype, but does
  not yet generate StreamData properties, Hypothesis suites, or Gleam test
  modules from pinned scenarios.
- State-machine projection needs source spans and artifact references, not only
  node ids, so the UI can explain which config or DSL clause created each
  state/transition.
- Sandboxed policy regions need clear uncertainty semantics in projection and
  simulation: what can be statically explained, what must be scenario-covered,
  and what remains opaque.

Interface expectation:

- Projection fields should remain deterministic and backend-owned even when the
  implementation underneath is simplistic.
- Simulation should report whether it used fixture scenarios, persisted
  scenarios, live replay, or generated inputs. A fixture-backed simulation is
  acceptable if the source is explicit.
- State-machine projections should describe their source: artifact-declared,
  compiler-derived, trace-derived, or default one-state.

## Security And Remote Operation Gaps

- Policy-authoring endpoints reuse localhost/admin-token protection. Remote MVP
  should decide whether authoring APIs require token-only access, CSRF/origin
  constraints, or a separate capability token model.
- Provider credentials have a minimal runtime lookup story: `credential_fnox_key`
  shells out to `fnox get KEY`, and `credential_env` remains acceptable for
  local development and live smoke tests. Fnox is not bundled or configured by
  Wardwright packaging, and neither fnox nor env vars solve service
  authorization. Remote operation still needs explicit model-use authorization,
  provider-configuration authorization, and audit-friendly secret management.
- Receipts and cache data can contain sensitive prompts or derived facts.
  Redaction rules for UI/API responses should be explicit before remote use.
- Multi-node visibility is plausible via PubSub, but clustering is not a
  tested product path yet. Remote MVP should state whether it supports
  single-node operation only, or visibility across clustered nodes.

## Suggested Next Slices

1. Run and harden the live-provider smoke profile against local Ollama and one
   configured OpenAI-compatible target.
2. Add MCP write tools for scenario recording/import/export only after the
   auth/review boundary is explicit.
3. Generate StreamData and Gleam regression modules from pinned scenario packs,
   then decide whether Python Hypothesis remains a cross-implementation oracle
   only or becomes a first-class export format.
