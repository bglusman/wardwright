# Feature Spikes

This page is a working backlog for self-directed Wardwright experiments. The goal
is not to chase every gateway feature. The goal is to find constrained agentic
workflows where a Wardwright model policy layer can measurably reduce failures,
cost, latency, or diagnosis time.

## Research Signals

Recent agent-observability writeups emphasize failures that ordinary request
logs do not explain well: tool misuse, context loss, goal drift, retry loops,
multi-agent cascading errors, and silent quality degradation. Latitude's March
2026 failure taxonomy is especially relevant because it maps each failure mode
to a detection strategy and argues for turning production traces into
regression tests.

LangGraph's human-in-the-loop docs draw a useful boundary: true human approval
requires interrupting execution, persisting graph state, and resuming with an
explicit decision. Wardwright's MVP alerting is much smaller: record a receipt
event and notify an operator without pausing the request.

oh-my-pi's Time Traveling Streamed Rules are the closest public analogue to
Wardwright's stream-policy idea: regex-triggered output stream rules that activate
only when the model starts producing relevant content, abort the stream, inject
a reminder, and retry once per session. Wardwright can generalize that into
backend-neutral Wardwright model policy with explicit receipt semantics and
bounded release latency.

## Experiment Matrix

| Spike | Why it might matter | MVP shape | Cost/risk | Success metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Structured output repair | JSON/XML drift is common and easy to test. | Final-output validator with retry-or-block. | Medium latency from retries; parser/schema design. | Lower invalid-output rate against fixtures. |
| Streaming TTSR | Known bad patterns can be stopped before consumers see them. | Buffered horizon, literal/regex trigger, retry with reminder. | Hard streaming semantics; visible latency. | Violating bytes never released in buffered mode. |
| Governance authoring assistant | Most users should describe desired behavior, not hand-write policy DSL. | Permissioned model selection, draft artifact generation, diff review, and simulation-guided revision. | Must avoid treating AI output as authoritative policy; prompt/data redaction matters. | User intent compiles to a valid rule with generated tests and human-approved artifact diff. |
| Policy graph and conflict workbench | Complex policies need visible ordering, parallel-safe groups, and conflict review. | Phase graph, rule cards, effect sets, arbitration badges, and conflict diagnostics. | UI can become too abstract unless grounded in examples and receipts. | Users can explain why a rule runs in parallel, ordered, or rejected before activation. |
| Starlark AST and trace workbench | Code-first policy might be viable if behavior can be visualized through AST projection and simulation traces. | Small Starlark policy editor, parsed branch/call graph, source-span highlights, scenario trace overlay, and opaque-branch warnings. | Static AST can imply more understanding than exists; runtime traces must be authoritative. | Users can identify which code branch/action caused a scenario difference without reading the full policy. |
| Dune snippet primitive simplification | Today's "primitives" are useful but not always mentally primitive. Predefined local Dune snippets might make behavior easier for agents and advanced users to inspect, fork, and edit. | Re-express existing structured behaviors as named Dune snippets behind the same action/result ABI, expose a snippet registry and evaluator over HTTP/MCP, and keep projection/simulation engine-neutral. The spike now routes legacy `engine: primitive` contains rules through `primitive.request-contains-actions` and request-side contains/regex rule decisions through `primitive.request-rule-action`, while host code still applies effects. Users and agents can also save reviewed local workspace snippets, evaluate them by id, delete them, and reference them from `engine: "dune"` artifacts by `snippet_id`. | Dune is not a hostile-code boundary; code-shaped authoring can hide product complexity if traces are weak. | A user can understand and safely modify a predefined behavior faster than with the current structured fields, without losing validation or scenario evidence. |
| Provider credential and caller auth hardening | Secret storage and service authorization are currently separate and easy to confuse. | Keep fnox/env references for provider credentials, add explicit model-use authorization and provider-configuration authorization, and make package startup warn when real credentials are configured without a trusted access boundary. | Product auth can sprawl; avoid building multi-tenant identity until deployment shape is clearer. | Operators can tell who may call each Wardwright model, who may edit providers, and where each provider credential is resolved without exposing secret values. |
| Structured-vs-code policy comparison | The primary authoring model is still an open product decision. | Build the same TTSR, cache-count, and model-switch policies in structured primitives and Starlark-first UIs against the same scenarios. | Parallel spikes can split focus unless they share scenarios and success criteria. | One approach clearly improves prediction, review, debugging, or trust for technical policy authors. |
| Tool-loop detector | Retry loops are expensive and diagnosable from session facts. | Session rolling counter keyed by tool/args/result hashes. | Needs agent/tool metadata standardization. | Fewer repeated equivalent calls in generated traces. |
| Async alert sinks | Makes policy value visible before full approval workflow exists. | Receipt event plus webhook/Telegram/Slack sink adapter. | Sink failure/backpressure semantics. | Policy trip reliably creates auditable delivery record. |
| Approval gate | Valuable for irreversible operations, but not just a notification. | Pending request state, approve/edit/reject, timeout. | Requires durable state and client UX contract. | Resumable approval tests pass without duplicate side effects. |
| Prompt variant receipts | Makes Wardwright useful as a prompt experiment boundary. | Versioned preamble/postscript transforms recorded in receipts. | Can become Helicone-style product sprawl. | Operators can compare outcomes by transform version. |
| Budget/context governor | Route decisions are central to Wardwright models. | Run/session counters and context-threshold route actions. | Budget facts need deterministic cache semantics. | Generated threshold tests produce stable route/degrade/alert choices. |
| Trace-to-regression importer | Converts production failures into examples and tests. | Receipt fixture import to BDD scenario generator. | Needs stable receipt schema and redaction. | A labeled incident becomes a failing test before fix. |

## First Example Library

The example policies should be intentionally boring before they are clever:

1. **Ambiguous success**: alert when an agent claims completion but required
   artifact metadata is absent.
2. **JSON contract**: retry once with validation feedback, then block if JSON
   is still invalid or missing required semantic fields.
3. **Deprecated API TTSR**: withhold streamed code long enough to catch
   `OldClient(`, retry with a reminder, and prove the bad bytes were not
   released.
4. **Repeated tool call**: count equivalent tool calls in a session and inject
   a reminder or alert after N repeats.
5. **Budget step-up**: record when a route crosses from cheap/local to
   expensive/managed and alert when a session crosses a configured spend window.

Each example needs:

- a model definition
- a BDD scenario
- a generated/property variant
- a receipt fixture
- a UI state that shows the trigger, action, latency, and release status
- an assistant prompt fixture that can regenerate or explain the rule draft
- a policy graph summary showing phase, effect set, and arbitration behavior

## What Not To Overbuild Yet

- Hosted marketplace policy monetization: keep manifest/provenance hooks, but
  do not let it drive MVP complexity.
- Full arbitrary receipt queries inside policy code: use deterministic declared
  working sets first.
- Synchronous human approval: document the contract now, implement after
  persistence/resume semantics are real.
- Provider-specific prompt management parity: record prompt transforms and
  variants first; broader A/B analytics can wait until receipts are richer.
- AI-authored opaque policy: the assistant may draft and review artifacts, but
  the runtime policy must remain compiled, deterministic, inspectable, and
  simulator-verifiable.
