    Wardwright is a control plane for agent-facing model behavior. Agents call a
    stable model name; operators define the route graph, policy, caller
    traceability, prompt transforms, alert hooks, and receipts behind that name.

<div class="notice">
  <strong>Status:</strong> Wardwright is early but installable. The prepared
  <code>v0.0.5</code> release publishes native macOS and Linux artifacts, a
  Homebrew formula, the active BEAM implementation, shared contracts, and
  a policy workbench with starter model examples, simulation playback, and
  local Dune snippet authoring for agents. See the [Backend Selection
  Decision](backend-selection-decision.html) for the pruning rationale.
</div>

## Install

Wardwright publishes native binaries through GitHub Releases and Homebrew.

### macOS Homebrew

```bash
brew tap bglusman/tap
brew install wardwright
brew services start wardwright
open http://127.0.0.1:8787/policies
```

### Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bglusman/wardwright/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
WARDWRIGHT_SECRET_KEY_BASE="$(openssl rand -base64 64)" \
WARDWRIGHT_BIND=127.0.0.1:8787 \
~/.local/bin/wardwright serve
```

For a pinned release, pass `--version v0.0.5` to the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bglusman/wardwright/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --version v0.0.5
```

The Linux installer verifies the release archive against published SHA-256
checksums before installing. Set `WARDWRIGHT_ADMIN_TOKEN` before exposing
Wardwright beyond loopback. See [Packaging](packaging.html) for manual archive
install steps, release targets, and service details.

## Provider Credentials

Wardwright can call local Ollama without credentials. OpenAI-compatible provider
targets can reference secrets through `credential_fnox_key` or `credential_env`;
the preferred local path is fnox, with Wardwright resolving credentials by
calling `fnox get KEY` at request time. Fnox is not bundled with Wardwright, and
it does not authenticate who may use Wardwright. Keep real provider credentials
on loopback-only instances or behind a trusted auth boundary. See
[Provider Credentials](provider-credentials.html).

## What Wardwright Adds

LLM agents often fail in ways that are easy to miss: repeated tool loops,
partial success treated as completion, malformed structured output, runaway
context growth, unclear model/provider selection, and weak visibility into who
or what triggered a run.

Wardwright adds a narrow control point between agent code and concrete model
providers. It is not primarily a security product. Security policies are one
useful family of examples, but the larger goal is controlled experimentation
and runtime visibility for constrained agentic workflows.

## Current Focus

The active prototype started by comparing Go, Rust, and Elixir backends against
the same HTTP contract, storage contract, BDD scenarios, and property-style
probes. That comparison has served its purpose. The live codebase now keeps the
Elixir backend as the primary runtime, with Gleam used for correctness-heavy
pure business logic and LiveView for the operator UI. The old Go and Rust
backends remain available in git history, but they are no longer part of the
current tree or verification gate.

The current installable build includes the OpenAI-compatible gateway surface,
synthetic model routing, stream-policy retries/rewrites, tool-context policy
hooks, policy history/cache state, protected authoring APIs, receipts, and an
initial LiveView workbench for policy diagrams, simulation playback, recipe
selection, and tool-governance demos.

## Policy Workbench

The installed app comes with a workbench at `/policies` for visualizing and
simulating synthetic models before they are used behind real traffic. It loads
seeded and locally authored examples, lets operators edit a scenario, and shows
the route, state, retry, rewrite, tool, and receipt effects produced by that
run.

</figure>

The `v0.0.5` package seeds example collections for output contracts,
route/model composition, stream repair and session state, plus tool/workflow
control. Models you create locally and store in the configured workspace recipe
directory use the same workbench path when they expose a supported projection.
Agents can also save, evaluate, compose, and delete local Dune snippets through
the protected MCP/API authoring surface.
See the [Policy Workbench](workbench.html) page for screenshots and the current
example catalog. External agents can use the local MCP/API authoring surface;
the [Agent Authoring Guide](agent-authoring.html) describes the expected
inspect, simulate, draft, validate, review, and activate workflow.

Near-term work:

1. Harden the policy workbench so projections and simulations are generated from
   persisted policy artifacts, compiled plans, and receipts.
2. Expand alert sinks and durable delivery/dead-letter semantics.
3. Add file-backed durable storage for model definitions and receipts, with
   Mnesia/SQL providers gated on concrete query, replication, or concurrency
   needs.
4. Broaden PubSub-backed visibility for model/session/receipt/policy events so
   LiveView and cluster nodes get near-real-time views without owning session
   state.
5. Use Dune-backed BEAM snippets for trusted local programmable policy only
   where structured primitives are insufficient.
6. Require WASM, a sidecar, or a hosted policy service for externally shared or
   otherwise untrusted programmable policy.

## Name

Wardwright is the tentative product name. The old working name, Ingary, was easy
to confuse and hard to remember. Code identifiers, protocol examples, and the
repository name now use `wardwright`; public project pages now use
`wardwright.dev`.
